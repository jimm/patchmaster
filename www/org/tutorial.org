* Tutorial

This tutorial walks you through creating a PatchMaster file from scratch. It
assumes you've installed PatchMater as a gem, which will also install
related utilities such as =unimidi=.

PatchMaster files are Ruby files. Since Ruby files typically use the
extension ".rb", go ahead and create a new file in your favorite editor
named "pm_tutorial.rb".

* Defining Your Instruments

** Find your instruments

In a terminal window, type

#+begin_src sh
  unimidi list
#+end_src

This command lists all the input and output instruments that are attached to
your Mac, whether physical or virtual. You'll need to remember the input and
output instrument numbers listed by =unimidi=.

** Add them to your PatchMaster file
