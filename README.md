# PatchMaster

PatchMaster is a MIDI processing and patching system. It allows a musician
to reconfigure a MIDI setup instantaneously and modify the MIDI data in real
time.

With PatchMaster a performer can split controlling keyboards, layer MIDI
channels, transpose them, send program changes and System Exclusive
messages, limit controller and velocity values, and much more. At the stomp
of a foot switch (or any other MIDI event), an entire MIDI system can be
totally reconfigured.

PatchMaster is totall programmable using Ruby. See the [examples](examples)
for a few ideas.

For more information please see the [documentation](site/index.md).
