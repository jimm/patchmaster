# usage: patchmaster [-i] [pm_file]
#
# Starts PatchMaster and optionally loads pm_file.
#
# The -n flag tells PatchMaster to not use MIDI. All MIDI errors such as not
# being able to connect to the MIDI devices speicified in pm_file are
# ignored, and no MIDI data is sent/received. That is useful if you want to
# run PatchMaster without actually talking to any MIDI devices.
